Dean made a point to Gomm, but it will apply to all front-end development, that we need to involve other people in the design of the interface. We need to come up with personas and test each other's applications pretending to be that person. Or get friends to use your application and give feedback.

Eg. Why did you order the buttons the way you did? Do you need to change the layout based on feedback? Is it taking too long to complete a task? Do people know what each button means? Do you need to add information icons with help on what the button means? 

Ideally we can do this before the IBM meeting next week so we can explain why it looks the way it does, because we had other people test it, not just ourselves.

I'm not sure what proof we have to give. But write down any feedback you get.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/420385146","","","","2014-07-21T07:42:43.787-07:00",""
